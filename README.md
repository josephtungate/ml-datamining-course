# ml-datamining-course
Coursework tasks for data mining and machine learning course. 

This project was developed as coursework for a data mining and machine learning course at Loughborough University. The project was awarded a 1st and has not been updated since submission (May 2023). The coursework specification has not been included to avoid copyright infringement. The project contains a series of Jupyter notebooks which carry out a variety of machine learning methods and the included datasets.
